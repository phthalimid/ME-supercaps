  abstract = {Over the last decade, optimizing energy storage has become significantly important in the field of energy conversion and sustainability. As a result of immense progress in the field, cost-effective and high performance batteries are imperative to meeting the future demand of sustainability. Currently, the best performing batteries are lithium-ion based, but limited lithium (Li) resources make research into alternatives essential. In recent years, the performance of aluminium-ion batteries has improved remarkably in all battery-relevant metrics, which renders them a promising alternative. Compared with monovalent Li-ion batteries, aluminium (Al) cations can carry three positive charges, which could result in higher energy densities. This review describes recent developments in Al-based cathode materials. The major goal of this review is to highlight strengths and weaknesses of various different approaches and provide guidelines for future research.},

  abstract = {Supercapacitors composed of slit-shaped micropores ranging in size from 0.67 to 1.8 nm in a room-temperature ionic liquid were studied to investigate the dependence of capacitance (C) on the pore size (d) using molecular dynamics simulations. The capacitance versus pore size (i.e., the C\textendash d curve) was found to exhibit two peaks located at 0.7 and 1.4 nm, respectively. Specifically, as the pore shrinks from 1.0 to 0.7 nm, the capacitance of the micropore increases anomalously, in good agreement with experimental observations. We report herein that the second peak within 1.0 to 1.8 nm is a new feature of the C\textendash d curve. Furthermore, by analogy to the wave interference, we demonstrate that the interference of two electrical double layers near each slit wall does not only explain the entire C\textendash d curve, including the anomalous character, but also predicts the oscillatory behavior of C\textendash d curve beyond 1.8 nm.},

The tailored multilevel pore system in the polymer scaffolds can be preserved through carbonization and thermal activation, yielding the multimodal porous carbon and activated carbon (AC) monoliths. The thin columnar macroframeworks are beneficial for electrode materials due to the short mass diffusion length through small pores (micro- and mesopores). By employing the nanostructured AC monolith as a binder-free electrode for supercapacitors, we have also explored the capability of ``water-in-salt'' electrolytes, aiming at high-voltage aqueous supercapacitors. Despite that the carbon electrode surface is supposed to be covered with salt-derived decomposition products that hinder the water reduction, the effective surface area contributing to electric double-layer capacitance in 5 M bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) is found to be comparable to that in a conventional neutral aqueous electrolyte. The expanded stability potential window of the superconcentrated electrolyte allows for a 2.4 V-class aqueous AC/AC symmetric supercapacitor with good cycle performance.},

However, the narrow electrochemical stability window (about 1.23 V) of the aqueous electrolyte sets a limit on their energy output. Herein, we have developed an aqueous rechargeable hybrid battery using Na2MnFe(CN)6 nanocubes as the cathode and a zinc metal sheet as the anode, which delivered a high energy density of 170 W h kg-1 and a capacity retention of 75\% over 2000 cycles with an operating voltage of up to 2.0 V. By adding sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to the aqueous electrolyte, the electrochemical stability window of the electrolyte was expanded to about 2.5 V. The results of the experiments and calculations based on the density functional theory indicate that SDS can not only inhibit the decomposition of water, suppress the dissolution of Mn and the corrosion of zinc but also increase the cycle life and rate capability. The low-cost, high energy density, and long cycle life of the battery suggest that it is a promising candidate for energy storage applications.},

  abstract = {Carbon materials with significant nitrogen contents were investigated as the electrode materials of supercapacitors. The preparation procedure involved the polymerization of melamine in the interlayer space of template fluorine mica and carbonization at 750, 850, and 1000 \textdegree C. Some samples were also stabilized prior to carbonization. We have shown previously that these carbons possess very interesting capacitive behavior in an acidic medium despite small surface areas. High capacitance values in H2SO4 were attributed to the pseudocapacitive interactions between the protons and nitrogen atoms. This paper further discusses the results obtained in a base and an aprotic electrolyte, KOH and TEABF4/PC, respectively. Electrochemical properties were evaluated with cycling voltammetry, a galvanostatic charge/discharge technique, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. High capacitance values were obtained in proton-free KOH, and the presence of pseudocapacitive interactions between the ions of the electrolyte and the nitrogen atoms of the carbon matrix is proposed. Compared to those in sulfuric acid, greater capacitances of nonstabilized samples were obtained in KOH, i.e., for the sample carbonized at 1000 \textdegree C, the capacitance was 84.61 F/g in KOH vs 47.92 F/g in H2SO4. On the other hand, less porous but more nitrogen-rich stabilized samples gave better performances in H2SO4, i.e., 62.24 F/g in H2SO4 compared to 49.86 F/g in KOH for the sample stabilized and carbonized at 1000 \textdegree C. The sample heat-treated at 750 \textdegree C with a surface area of ca. 400 m2/g performs similarly in both electrolytes, i.e., {$\sim$}200 F/g. Significantly lower gravimetric capacitances were obtained in TEABF4/PC from the samples carbonized at 750 \textdegree C. On the other hand, the almost nonporous sample subjected to stabilization prior to carbonization at 1000 \textdegree C gave a capacitance of {$\sim$}20 F/g. Hence, we suggest that the faradaic interactions between the carbon electrode material and the electrolyte, although much less significant than those in H2SO4 and KOH, play an important role in the nonaqueous electrolyte as well. Narrow micropores were detected by CO2 adsorption/desorption, and their importance to the interpretation of capacitive behavior is also discussed.},

Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in microemulsions and micellar solutions is incorporated to form micelles within the cationic films. This changes the net film charge from positive, characteristic of the protonated lysines, to negative, characteristic of SDS micelles. Micelle formation was supported by voltammetry and quartz crystal microbalance results, which also suggested that cationic surfactants do not enter the film. Catalytic turnover rates for the reduction of dibromocyclohexane to cyclohexene mediated by the film in SDS microemulsions were controlled by the difference between the reduction potential of the reactant and the catalyst E\textdegree ` in the film. Thus, reaction rate in these systems is controlled by the intrinsic activation free energy. For a given reactant, catalyst E\textdegree `, and consequently activation free energy, can be controlled by microemulsion composition via interactions of surfactant and salt with the polymer network. Fast catalyst turnover was also facilitated by high conductivity and low viscosity of the bulk microemulsion.},

  abstract = {The use of flowing electrochemical reactors, for example in redox flow batteries and in various electrosynthesis processes, is increasing. This technology has the potential to be of central significance in the increased deployment of renewable electricity for carbon-neutral processes. A key element of optimizing efficiency of electrochemical reactors is the combination of high solution conductivity and reagent solubility. Here we show a substantial rate of charge transfer for an electrochemical reaction occurring in a microemulsion containing electroactive material is loaded inside the nonpolar (toluene) subphase of the microemulsion. The measured rate constant translates to an exchange current density comparable to that in redox flow batteries. The rate could be controlled by the surfactant, which maintains partitioning of reactants and products by forming an interfacial region with ions in the aqueous phase in close proximity. The hypothesized mechanism is evocative of membrane-bound enzymatic reactions. Achieving sufficient rates of electrochemical reaction is the product of an effort designed to establish a reaction condition that meets the requirements of electrochemical reactors by using microemulsions to realize a separation of conducting and reactive elements of the solution, opening a door to the broad use of microemulsions to effect controlled electrochemical reactions as steps in more complex processes.},

This review provides comprehensive knowledge to this field.

Then we move to the recent progress made for the design and fabrication of electrode materials and the overall structure of asymmetric supercapacitors in different categories.

Suo et al. smash through this limit with an aqueous salt solution containing lithium (Li) bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide to create an electrolyte that has an electrochemical window of 3 V (see the Perspective by Smith and Dunn). They used extremely high-concentration solutions, which suppressed hydrogen evolution and electrode oxidation. At these concentrations, the Li solvation shell changes because there simply is not enough water to neutralize the Li+ charge. Thus, flammable organic electrolytes could potentially be replaced with a safer aqueous alternative. Science, this issue p. 938; see also p. 918 Lithium-ion batteries raise safety, environmental, and cost concerns, which mostly arise from their nonaqueous electrolytes. The use of aqueous alternatives is limited by their narrow electrochemical stability window (1.23 volts), which sets an intrinsic limit on the practical voltage and energy output. We report a highly concentrated aqueous electrolyte whose window was expanded to \textasciitilde 3.0 volts with the formation of an electrode-electrolyte interphase. A full lithium-ion battery of 2.3 volts using such an aqueous electrolyte was demonstrated to cycle up to 1000 times, with nearly 100\% coulombic efficiency at both low (0.15 C) and high (4.5 C) discharge and charge rates. The electrochemical stability window of an aqueous electrolyte is expanded to 3 volts.

Herein, this study reports a novel Ni?Mn?O solid-solution cathode to widen the supercapacitor device voltage, which can potentially suppress the oxygen evolution reaction and thus be operated stably within a quite wide potential window of 0?1.4 V (vs saturated calomel electrode) after a simple but unique phase-transformation electrochemical activation. The solid-solution structure is designed with an ordered array architecture and in situ nanocarbon modification to promote the charge/mass transfer kinetics. By paring with commercial activated carbon anode, an ultrahigh voltage asymmetric supercapacitor in neutral aqueous LiCl electrolyte is assembled (2.4 V; among the highest for single-cell supercapacitors). Moreover, by using a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)?LiCl electrolyte, a 2.4 V hydrogel supercapacitor is further developed with an excellent Coulombic efficiency, good rate capability, and remarkable cycle life ({$>$}5000 cycles; 95.5\% capacity retention).
